# FANtium Platform

Fantium Code Challenge

Welcome to my solution for the Fantium Code Challenge!

In order to access the application you'll need to have metamask installed in your browser. You can import the [contract owner wallet](https://github.com/olmaygti/fantium/blob/ca856374679c1afcdb5799c66c1b00a2873a7f90/contracts/truffle-config.js#L82) to login in the application with administrator privileges.


This platform consists of 4 main components:

* [Contracts](https://github.com/olmaygti/fantium/tree/master/contracts) project containing the [FantiumMetaToken.sol](./contracts/contracts/FantiumMetaToken.sol) contract, holding all the NFT shares for all Fantium Athletes.

* [Fantium API](https://github.com/olmaygti/fantium/tree/master/back/fantium-api) offering a thin layer of services to our clients.
